/*
In order to build the magic object that I want I have to "build it first".
First I have to build the feathers service factory.
Next I have to build the feathers services factory which should recieve a singular feathers service string.
within the feathers service factory I should create 2 queries and 3 mutations. (all crud operations)
it should then return the build objects.
the feathers services should accept an array of feathers services. and return an array of built services that came from build feathers service
